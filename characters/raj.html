        Raju is a daring, and mischievous 4-year old boy, he is a bald toddler with only two strands of hair on his head who wears nothing but his blue underpants. Raju's size belies his courage, which he gets from his father, commander of the King's army. Raju also wants to be the commander of the Army. He is a prodigy at archery and has won the "Arjuna Cup". Raju is also very articulate and intelligent for his age, being able to converse and follow along with his older friends on their adventures with no difficulty.
