        Kalia is an envious bully. He is 10-years old and depicted as an ambitious boy who is always outshone by Bheem. He has two fearful lackeys, Dholu and Bholu, twin brothers who sometimes help him with his plans and, at other times, quickly abandon him. He often blows his own trumpet by claiming he is the strongest and most courageous person. Whenever any problem arises, he runs away. Despite his competitive personality, he also helps the gang out for important matters (such as an attack on Dholakpur) and will put aside his own rivalries and pride for the greater good.
