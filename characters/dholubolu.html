        Dholu and Bholu are identical twins and followers of Kalia. Though they are not strong themselves, they bask in Kalia's strength. Despite their support for a bully, they have kind hearts and have also won a trophy for their close brotherhood. But sometimes, they argue among themselves and get scolded by Kalia. They are differentiated by their clothing, each twin wears a similar set of olive green and brown turban, t-shirt and pants with opposite colouring.
